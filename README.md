# ETL - Extract, Transform, Load

## Purpose
A hypothetical company, Amazing Prime Video, would like to develop an algorithm to predict which low budget movies being released will become popular. They have decided to sponsor a hackaton asking participants to predict popular pictures given a dataset. 

An employee, Britta, needs help with creating the datasets for the hackaton. She needs to extract data from both Wikipedia and Kaggle, transform it into one clean data set, and finally load that dataset into a SQL database for the hackaton participants. The task is to make an automated pipeline.
